# Configure TYPO3 Reverse Proxy for nexaa.io

This container image is a lightweight, one-shot utility to help configure TYPO3 for use behind a reverse proxy 
‚Äî specifically for deployments on [nexaa.io](https://nexaa.io).

It copies an `additional.php` configuration file into your mounted TYPO3 configuration directory, 
typically at `typo3conf/system/` for classic installations or `config/system/` for Composer-based installations.

## üöÄ How to Use
